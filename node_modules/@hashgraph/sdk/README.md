## Usage

This SDK supports both running in the browser (with Webpack) and in Node.

(Code examples using `await` assume an `async` context.)

#### Installation
```shell script
# with NPM
$ npm install --save @hashgraph/sdk
# with Yarn
$ yarn add @hashgraph/sdk
```

#### Creating a client
```typescript
import {Client} from "@hashgraph/sdk";

const client = new Client({ 
    // this key defaults to this url, a public free proxy to the Hedera public testnet
    // generously hosted by MyHederaWallet.com
    network: { "https://grpc-web.myhederawallet.com": "0.0.3" },
    operator: {
        // the account which signs transactions and query payments by default
        account: { shard: 0, realm: 0, account: ___ },
        // the private key used to sign the transactions, either encoded as a string
        // or as an `Ed25519PrivateKey` type 
        privateKey: "..."
    },
});
```

#### Checking your balance

```typescript
console.log('current account balance:', await client.getAccountBalance());
```

#### Sending a transfer

```typescript
// the amount parameter can either be a `number` or a bignumber.js type
new CryptoTransferTransaction()
    .addSender({ shard: 0, realm: 0, account: ___ }, 10_000_000)
    .addRecipient({ shard: 0, realm: 0, account: ___ }, 10_000_000)
    .build(client)
    .execute(client);
```

#### Creating a new Account

```typescript
import { Ed25519PrivateKey } from "@hashgraph/sdk";

const privateKey = await Ed25519PrivateKey.generate();
const publicKey = privateKey.publicKey;

const tx = new AccountCreateTransaction()
    .setKey(privateKey.publicKey)
    .setInitialBalance(0)
    .build(client);

await tx.execute(client);
const receipt = await tx.getReceipt(client);
const newAccount = receipt.accountId;

console.log('new account: ', newAccount, 'public key: ', publicKey.toString(), ' private key: ', privateKey.toString());
```

## Running locally

Do you want to run this SDK locally or help contribute? 

Checkout the [DEVELOPING.md](DEVELOPING.md) file to get started!

## Proxying from a browser

By default, you can specify which nodes you'd like to submit to, but this assumes that you're running in a server environment. If you're running from the browser, the SDK defaults to a gRPC proxy hosted by [myhbarwallet](https://myhbarwallet.com/) and the [LaunchBadge](https://launchbadge.com/) team. If you'd like to run your own proxy, please checkout the [PROXY.md](PROXY.md) file to get setup!
